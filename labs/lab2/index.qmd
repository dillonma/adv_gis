### What to turn-in

Please do the R work in R Markdown. Your Rmd file will be generated. Save this file as a PDF (or print to PDF) and **turn in the PDF file(s) and the Rmd file(s)**.

Work through Chapters 1 through 4 of _Analyzing US Census Data_. Use an Rmd file to keep track of your progress.

At the beginning of the Rmd file, use Markdown formatting to answer these questions:

    -   What worked well for you and what didn't work?
    -   Does the importance of using something like RMarkdown 
    -   What would you like to see different?

**Hint:** Use PDFSam (or install it with Chocolatey) to merge multiple PDFs together. For example, create a layout in QGIS and export those maps to PDF. Then use PDFSam to merge those files.
