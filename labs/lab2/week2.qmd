## Setting up RStudio

-   If it's not installed already, refer to Lab 1.
-   You need to install R (the language) AND RStudio (the IDE - Integrated Development Environment)
-   The is what you use to write R code, but when you "run" the code, it refers to R (technically "rlang")

## Settings in RStudio

-   Important to not open up your last project
-   Don't save you .RData (variables)
-   Be deliberate about your code!

## Why focus on reproducibility?

-   There is a reproducibility "crisis" in science
-   Social and natural, in any field where we want to show a relationship between two or multiple phenomenon
-   It's not just about "data" it's about how what the data represents, how it is used, and whether or not we can make the same conclusions from that data

## Data and methods matter

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Ontology: what is reality/true
-   Epistemology: methods for figuring out reality/truth (or best approximation)

## Why we focus on this?

 - You won't necessarily be the owner of your work in the future. 
 - Reproducibility improves the legibility of your work.
 - Reproducibility improves the accuracy of your work.
