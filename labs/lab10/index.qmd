## Lab 10 / Week 14

### Directions

There are two main parts to this lab: GitHub editing and making a web map. We'll use ChatGPT to help with both.

#### Web Mapping

First, open QGIS and install the plugin `qgis2web`. Follow the tutorial [here](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/web_mapping_with_qgis2web.html) to learn about the plugin. I can't stress enough how much I recommend doing this entire tutorial (up to Step 28), but you won't turn it in.

Instead, you'll make a map of your own choosing. Consider the different data sources we've used in this class and your other GIS work. Ask [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), for example, "Where is a good place to download GIS data about coffeeshops?" and it will most likely send you to [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/). But we've also used tidycensus and the USGS Earth Explorer in this class.

Please export using Mapbox. Once you're happy with your webmap, rename the html file to index.html and upload to its own folder in the portfolio folder on your GitHub Portfolio. You should now be able to link to it, but it might also be useful to take as small screenshot with Win + Shift + S and use that as a picture for your Portfolio page -- meaning you'll want to create a portfolio page like you did with the other pages that describes the map, your data sources, and the software you used to create it.

You'll turn in a link to the Portfolio page of this map (not the index.html, but the landing page for this project in GitHub).

#### GitHub

**Delete the items in \_posts folder**. You won't need these.

**Rename the menu header from CV to Resume.** This is optional, but it's good practice. Consider cleaning up the rest of your menu and making sure there is no spurious links/content.

**Edit the about.md file**: The about page is the landing page for your site. landing page is one of the most important pages on your website. It should be a little bit about you, your goals in the workforce, and list the skills you have in a narrative form. It should also link to several of the item in your portfolio as demonstrations of the skills you've used. I recommend using [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) here to provide some template wording that you will heavily modify. We'll run through an example in class. It makes sense to create an image that is a link. You can use [this tutorial](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-make-picture-into-link) (see Step #5) or ask ChatGPT how to do it.

### Grading

This I'll be looking for while I'm grading, 5 points each.

1.  Did you properly link to your web map from a dedicated portfolio page?
2.  Is your web map *polished*?
3.  Is your website presentable? Are there no obvious errors and no extra content/links?
4.  Is the content professional in manner?

### Turn-in

::: {.alert .alert-info}
### What to turn-in

1.  **Turn in a link to your website** (not the backend, I'll heavily dock for improper links). No cover pages.
