-   See this for the [weekly challenge](https://erdavis.com/2022/02/09/how-i-made-the-viral-map/) (required for grad students, optional for undergrads). Please reproduce this with your own data, but don't use special fonts and instead use data from `tidycensus`. **See the [in-class example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8oduc02415qi0z0/w3challenge.zip?dl=1) that we improved here from here.**

### Turn-in

::: {.alert .alert-info}
### What to turn-in

Please do the R work in R Markdown. Knit your Rmd file to HTML and open it in the browser. Save this file as a PDF (or print to PDF) and **turn in the PDF file(s) and the Rmd file(s)**.

1.  Work through Chapters 5 through 7 of *Analyzing US Census Data*. Use an Rmd file to keep track of your progress.
2.  At the beginning of the Rmd file, use Markdown formatting to answer these questions:
    -   What is the purpose of having different folders? Why do we use R projects (.Rproj) files for everything we do?
    -   Please explain what goes into each of these folders: bin, data, doc, results, src
3.  An Rmd and PDF for the challenge if you do it.

**Hint:** Do NOT Knit to PDF. **Knit to HTML, open the file in your browser, then print to PDF.** Use PDFSam (or install it with Chocolatey) to merge multiple PDFs together. For example, create a layout in QGIS and export those maps to PDF. Then use PDFSam to merge those files.
