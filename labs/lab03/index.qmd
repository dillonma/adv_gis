### Lab 3 Assignment

[Lab 03 Project](/files/lab03.zip)

Lab 3 asks a number of questions of a dataset, and then asks you to create a map using data that you export out of RStudio. Create a visually pleasing map using the variable `gapminder` dataset (using either <mark>2007</mark> **life expectancy or GDP per capita**). Be sure to add your name, the assignment name, a legend with professional titles, a small and minimalist North arrow, and a scale bar.

Use your best judgement on projection, colors, etc. Install the plugin `HCMQGIS` to find a base map should you choose to use it (there are also other packages).
