## Lab 7

### Background

Don't skimp on these! There are some really useful links in here!

-   For tips on plotting and doing the correlation, see this [tutorial](https://thomaselove.github.io/431notes-2017/straight-line-models-and-correlation.html).
-   [Here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/ordinary-least-squares-ols-linear-regression-in-r/) is how to do a regression line in R, often called Ordinary Least Squares. We'll continue to work on this through-out the rest of the course.

-   [My portfolio page](https://dillonma.github.io/), and the [backend](https://github.com/dillonma/dillonma.github.io/) (with the `README.md`) file that I use to keep my own resources.

### Directions

#### GitHub Pages (not graded separately)

Add a project to your GitHub portfolio, follow instructions from in-class demo. **Submit a link to your portfolio page here** (not the backend).

#### Spatial Analysis (graded separately, please turn-in the PDF as well as zip file)

For a demonstration of collecting data for Lab 7, see this [demonstration project](https://github.com/dillonma/adv_gis/blob/main/files/lab07demo.zip).  <mark>Be sure to selected download.</mark>

1.  Qmd Part 1: Follow the steps [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/6a_local_auto/lab6a.html) (<https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/6a_local_auto/lab6a.html>) to do your first lab in GeoDa. The sample data set can be downloaded [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/Guerry/) (<https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/Guerry/>). Reproduce this section in a Qmd.

2.  Qmd Part 2: For any coastal/river-based place/county, use `tidycensus` to download data on two different variables that you think are related, *at the census tract level*, and explore a relationship between the two variables using GeoDa. Use `erase_water` to remove water from the shapefile. Save results into a shapefile and render this portion to html, then print to PDF.

3.  QGIS: Use your shapefile to produce a polished map showing the relationship. Include all the necessary components for a map.

4.  Qmd Part 3: Explain what you did and your findings for Part 2. Include maps where necessary to show the geography and the erasure of water.

### Grading

This I'll be looking for while I'm grading.

1.  (15 points) In your Quarto: What are the comments like, both in r chunks and in text? Are they sufficient? Is the formatting of the markdown proper? Are the headers done properly? Are r chunks named appropriately (hint: is there a setup r chunk)?

2.  (10 points) Are the polished maps actually polished? Follow the guidelines discussed in class.

3.  (5 points) Is your write-up clear? Does it explain the relationship?

Explore GeoDa, which has excellent documentation, and come come up do something that you're proud of.

### Turn-in

### What to turn-in

**Turn in a single PDF.** - On the first page, please include a short header. - Complete the exercises and produce a polished map. - The output of your Qmd should be an HTML, which you then open and print to PDF.
