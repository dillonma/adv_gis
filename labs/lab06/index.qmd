## Lab 6 / Week 6

![Hexagons and census tracts](/material/hexagons.png)

### Background

Don't skimp on these! There are some really useful links in here!

-   Add a glow to your water in QGIS via [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb8EJFV4SLs).

-   Layout Manager in QGIS via [QGIS documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/training_manual/map_composer/map_composer.html).

-   Walker's book chapter 7, specifically on analyzing census data via [Walker Data](https://walker-data.com/census-r/spatial-analysis-with-us-census-data.html).

-   Advanced notes on rate mapping via [Spatial Data Science](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/lab_tutorials/Rate_mapping.html).

-   More tutorials via [Spatial Data Science](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/).

-   Moran's I explanation via [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J_bmWmOF3I) (this is really good, I promise).

### Directions

#### GitHub Pages

~~Please iterate on your Portfolio. Create a portfolio page that shows your map from week 4 and a separate portfolio page from this week. Please include a small write-up. We will go over this on March 14th.~~ <mark>We'll do this after Spring Break.</mark>

#### Spatial Analysis

Complete the exercises in the [w6_demo.Rmd](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cs3p5emv0aqer0z/w6.zip?dl=0) **in a new file** and include a write-up as stated.

### Grading

This I'll be looking for while I'm grading.

1.  Is your project folder organized properly? Are the necessary folders and files all there (hint: where will you st_write your files)?

2.  What are the comments like, both in r chunks and in text? Are they sufficient? Is the formatting of the markdown proper? Are the headers done properly? Are r chunks named appropriately (hint: is there a setup r chunk)?

3.  Are the maps of the three variables correct in the output of the Rmd?

4.  Are the polished maps actually polished? Is there a single (not three) north arrow and scale bar? Is there a title and your name? What is the source of your data?

### Turn-in

::: {.alert .alert-info}
### What to turn-in

1.  **Turn in a single PDF.**
    -   On the first page, please include a short header. Please also include a link to your GitHub page and your GitHub website. Note that these are different. Please also include a *small* screenshot of your portfolio pages.
    -   I recommend putting your write-up of the Moran's I in here (in addition to in your Rmd).
    -   Complete the exercises and produce a polished poster map.
    -   Please feel free to build on the w6_demo.Rmd that is included, but copy and rename the file to have your work in it. The outputs from your Rmd should be an HTML, then printed to PDF.
2.  **A zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted**. You won't be able to include the data, but what other files should you include and which folders should they go in?
