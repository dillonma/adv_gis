## Lab 9 / Week 13

### ![](/material/manchester.png)

### Background

Don't skimp on these! There are some really useful links in here!

-   [Appendix "Raster operations in R"](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/raster-operations-in-r.html) from Intro to GIS and Spatial Analysis by Gimond (2019).

-   [Raster manipulation](https://rspatial.org/raster/spatial/8-rastermanip.html) from Spatial data science by Hijmans (2016). This last one is another tutorial.

-   [Intro to Rasters in R](https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToRaster/) from Wageningen Research. A good tutorial on Rasters.

-   [Raster `Stack`](https://rdrr.io/cran/raster/man/stack.html) Documentation

-   [How to use the `here` package](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/how-to-use-the-here-package/) from Jen Richmond.

### Directions

#### <mark>Update</mark>

Only go through 8.10 in the following tutorial. No need to do your own county, but kudos if you do.

#### Working with Rasters

Complete the assignment Rmd file in the data folder. [Follow the tutorial from Andrew MacLachlan](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/advanced-raster-analysis.html#data-2), but don't start from scratch, start from the Project folder/file here: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpg4aqcqrdsesrh/lab9.zip?dl=0>

To download data from [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/):

1.  On the Search tab, once you zoom in appropriately to your location, click the Use Map button, then click Data Sets to advance to the next section.
2.  Select Landsat \> Landsat Collection 2 Level-1 \> Landsat 8-9 OLI/TRS C2 L1, then click Results. You might get a warning that you can ignore.
3.  Click on the footprint button for the appropriate coverage. Once you find the appropriate image, click the download icon.
4.  In Download Options dialog box that appears, click the Product Options button and then click the top button for the "Bundle" - you'll then need to unzip the files (no subfolders) into the lab9/data/landsat folder.

### Grading

This I'll be looking for while I'm grading.

1.  Is your project folder organized properly? Are the necessary folders and files all there (hint: where will you st_write your files)?

2.  What are the comments like, both in r chunks and in text? Are they sufficient? Is the formatting of the markdown proper? Are the headers done properly? Are r chunks named appropriately (hint: is there a setup r chunk)?

3.  Consider the assignment Rmd **incomplete** and be sure fill it out as necessary. Hint: name your r chunks for debugging!

4.  Are the maps correct? Projected?

5.  Are the polished maps actually polished?

### Turn-in

::: {.alert .alert-info}
### What to turn-in

1.  **Turn in a single PDF.**
    -   On the first page, please include a short header. Please also include a link to your GitHub page and your GitHub website. Note that these are different.
    -   Complete assignment Rmd and answer all the questions in there. Knit it to html, then print to PDF and combine it with the cover page.
2.  **A zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted**. You won't be able to include the data, but what other files should you include and which folders should they go in?
