Know the difference between the backend (code) and the front end (formatted web page) to turn-in GitHub links. Assignments will be posted on Blackboard (links) and GitHub.\n\n\nComputing. I recommend using your own personal laptop in this course, however, you’re free to use one of the lab computers. I recommend using the same computer for each class.\nDiscord + Community. Technical learning alone is a recipe for disaster. Rely on your fellow classmates and ask questions in the class discord. This link is an invite for Discord for the first week of class. https://discord.gg/9wUhDdQV\nSchedule.. Mondays we will spend on lecturing. Wednesdays we’ll start with a quick in-class exercise before moving into lab time. Quizzes will be on Wednesdays.\n\n\n\nO’Sullivan, David. 2024.

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.\n✅ Policy: https://oue.umbc.edu/ai/\n\n\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the UMBC requires students register with the Office of Student Disability Services and I will work with you and the SDS to ensure your success.\n✅ Policy: http://sds.umbc.edu/accommodations/registering-with-sds\n\n\n\nWith UMBC, I am dedicated to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of the campus community and recognizes its responsibility to maintain a campus environment which is free from Sexual Misconduct, and other Related Misconduct. This Policy embodies the University’s commitment to increasing awareness of such prohibited conduct and actively promoting prevention and educational programs for community members in an effort to eliminate occurrences, prevent re-occurrences, and address and remedy the discriminatory effects of the Sexual Misconduct. For additional resources, see UMBC’s policy posted online.\n✅ Policy: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/umbc-resource-page-for-sexual-misconduct-andother-related-misconduct/\n✅ File a complaint: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/file-a-complaint/\nIf you need to speak to someone, UMBC has the following resources available to support you:\n\nThe Counseling Center (confidential): 410-455-2472\nUniversity Health Services (confidential): 410-455-2542\nAfter-hours counseling and care available by calling campus police at: 410-455-5555\nThe Women’s Center (quasi-confidential): 410-455-2714\nTitle IX Coordinator (quasi-confidential): 410-455-1606\n\n✅ Additional on and off campus supports and resources can be found at: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexualmisconduct/gender-equitytitle-ix/"

Are there any examples from this work that might be useful to you?\n\nWe learned how to use QGIS to create new print layouts.\nWe learned how to work with census data in interesting ways, visual design tips, and principles of reproducible research.\nWe learned more about census data, how to assemble multiple plots (and potentially maps) in ggplot, how to make leaflet web maps, how to move Alaska and Hawaii in US plots, and how to use the package tigris with tidycensus, and how to do change over time with the census. Most importantly check out the clustering examples in Chapter 7 of the Analyzing US Census book.\nWe mapped interesting data of our own and made maps (this could be a mini-final project, can you expand on this?)\nWe learned how to make hexagonal maps to combine points or to do area weighted calculations. And we did a Moran’s I to measure spatial clustering and dispersion.\nWe learned how to do correlations.\nAnd we learned how to do point pattern analysis and make heatmaps.\nOur next lab will look at data from rasters.\nWe’ll done one more spatial analysis lab.\n\n\n\n\nThe expectation is that the final project is at a minimum 20 hours of work. It is a semester long project.\nThe focus is on doing analysis on maps (not just mapping something) and thinking through how we can interpret what we map. For example, it’s not enough to map income in Baltimore. How is this related to other social or environmental variables? How did you compare/correlate/assess that relationship? In what ways did you investigate it with multiple plots, statistics, etc?\nI expect data come from multiple sources - so not JUST census data.\nI expect the analysis to be done in R following the guidelines of reproducible research. I recommend making polished maps in QGIS, although you don’t have to use QGIS, you can do it in any graphics editor. ArcGIS Pro and Desktop are not to be used.\n\n\n\nLook below and think through what a rough draft of the Introduction + Background section would look like as well as the Data + Methods section. Then write a 1-page proposal. This should contain links to the data and how you plan on manipulating the data. What you submit here does not have to be what you end up doing, but you have to be able to download and look at the data you plan on using.\n\n\n\nThere are multiple deliverables and they need to be submitted via Blackboard.\nYou should only submit TWO files on Blackboard.\nYour files as a zipped project folder. This should have an R project file. If you used QGIS, then it should include your QGIS project file. I recommend exporting finalized data from R and opening the shapefiles in QGIS. Use what we’ve learned about folder structure to organize your files.\nWhile the range of projects can vary, there are some particular\nA single PDF that includes:\n\nA cover page that includes your name, GitHub website link (github.io), and your GitHub website repository (github.io), and a link to your final project portfolio page that has a short description of your work (github.io).\nA 2-page research brief (like a report, 800-1200ish words) with these sections:\n\nIntroduction + Background. What is it that you’re studying? Why is it important? How is it connected to work you’ve done in other classes? Hint: use citations. What is it that you studied?\nData + Methods. Where did you get the data? How did you manipulate the data? How did you spatially analyze the data and why is that method useful (use citations). Explain each step. It may help to look back at your Rmd file and describe what you did.\nAnalysis + Results. What are the numerical results? What does your analysis tell us?\nConclusion. Interpret your results. What does this mean?\nReflection.\n\nWhat went well and didn’t go well for this project? What would you do differently next time?\nWhat went well and didn’t go well in the class? What would you have liked to have learned?\n\nNot as a separate section, but integrated into the text should be polished maps. I realize this will go over the 2 pages, but try to target 1,000 words total.\n\nA printed to PDF version of your final project portfolio page. It should not include all the of the debrief, just a summarized version of it. It does not need to be technical, but something short that someone who doesn’t know GIS should be able to understand. Here’s an example from last year, but I expect you to do better.\nGraduate Student Poster. A poster of your work (turned into a PDF and included in the single PDF). I’ll provide a template and some guidelines later.\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nSubmission (5). Did you submit the correct files?\nGitHub overall (10). Is your GitHub Portfolio in order? Do the links on the left work? Did you delete the extra content?\nGitHub Final Project Page (30). Did you include images on the Portfolio page and the Project page? Did you adequately describe your project for a lay person?\nReport (40). Did you do spatial analysis? Did you explain what you did? Did you cite examples from the books? Did you cite any examples outside of class?\nMaps (15). Do the maps follow design and color guidelines we’ve talked about? Is the North Arrow not enormous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted.

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.\n✅ Policy: https://oue.umbc.edu/ai/\n\n\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.

    "text": "Review the work we’ve done to date. See the useful links in all of the labs we’ve done to date. How might they help you? Are there any examples from this work that might be useful to you?\n\nWe learned how to use QGIS to create new print layouts.\nWe learned how to work with census data in interesting ways, visual design tips, and principles of reproducible research.\nWe learned more about census data, how to assemble multiple plots (and potentially maps) in ggplot, how to make leaflet web maps, how to move Alaska and Hawaii in US plots, and how to use the package tigris with tidycensus, and how to do change over time with the census. Most importantly check out the clustering examples in Chapter 7 of the Analyzing US Census book.\nWe mapped interesting data of our own and made maps (this could be a mini-final project, can you expand on this?)\nWe learned how to make hexagonal maps to combine points or to do area weighted calculations. And we did a Moran’s I to measure spatial clustering and dispersion.\nWe learned how to do correlations.\nAnd we learned how to do point pattern analysis and make heatmaps.\nOur next lab will look at data from rasters.\nWe’ll done one more spatial analysis lab.\n\n\n\n\nThe expectation is that the final project is at a minimum 20 hours of work. It is a semester long project.\nThe focus is on doing analysis on maps (not just mapping something) and thinking through how we can interpret what we map. For example, it’s not enough to map income in Baltimore. How is this related to other social or environmental variables? How did you compare/correlate/assess that relationship? In what ways did you investigate it with multiple plots, statistics, etc?\nI expect data come from multiple sources - so not JUST census data.\nI expect the analysis to be done in R following the guidelines of reproducible research. I recommend making polished maps in QGIS, although you don’t have to use QGIS, you can do it in any graphics editor. ArcGIS Pro and Desktop are not to be used.\n\n\n\nLook below and think through what a rough draft of the Introduction + Background section would look like as well as the Data + Methods section. Then write a 1-page proposal. This should contain links to the data and how you plan on manipulating the data. What you submit here does not have to be what you end up doing, but you have to be able to download and look at the data you plan on using.\n\n\n\nThere are multiple deliverables and they need to be submitted via Blackboard.\nYou should only submit TWO files on Blackboard.\nYour files as a zipped project folder. This should have an R project file. If you used QGIS, then it should include your QGIS project file. I recommend exporting finalized data from R and opening the shapefiles in QGIS. Use what we’ve learned about folder structure to organize your files.\nWhile the range of projects can vary, there are some particular\nA single PDF that includes:\n\nA cover page that includes your name, GitHub website link (github.io), and your GitHub website repository (github.io), and a link to your final project portfolio page that has a short description of your work (github.io).\nA 2-page research brief (like a report, 800-1200ish words) with these sections:\n\nIntroduction + Background. What is it that you’re studying? Why is it important? How is it connected to work you’ve done in other classes? Hint: use citations. What is it that you studied?\nData + Methods. Where did you get the data? How did you manipulate the data? How did you spatially analyze the data and why is that method useful (use citations). Explain each step. It may help to look back at your Rmd file and describe what you did.\nAnalysis + Results. What are the numerical results? What does your analysis tell us?\nConclusion. Interpret your results. What does this mean?\nReflection.\n\nWhat went well and didn’t go well for this project? What would you do differently next time?\nWhat went well and didn’t go well in the class? What would you have liked to have learned?\n\nNot as a separate section, but integrated into the text should be polished maps. I realize this will go over the 2 pages, but try to target 1,000 words total.\n\nA printed to PDF version of your final project portfolio page. It should not include all the of the debrief, just a summarized version of it. It does not need to be technical, but something short that someone who doesn’t know GIS should be able to understand. Here’s an example from last year, but I expect you to do better.\nGraduate Student Poster. A poster of your work (turned into a PDF and included in the single PDF). I’ll provide a template and some guidelines later.\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nSubmission (5). Did you submit the correct files?\nGitHub overall (10). Is your GitHub Portfolio in order? Do the links on the left work? Did you delete the extra content?\nGitHub Final Project Page (30). Did you include images on the Portfolio page and the Project page? Did you adequately describe your project for a lay person?\nReport (40). Did you do spatial analysis? Did you explain what you did? Did you cite examples from the books? Did you cite any examples outside of class?\nMaps (15). Do the maps follow design and color guidelines we’ve talked about? Is the North Arrow not enormous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted.

Follow the tutorial from Andrew MacLachlan, but don’t start from scratch, start from the Project folder/file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpg4aqcqrdsesrh/lab9.zip?dl=0\nTo download data from Earth Explorer:\n\nOn the Search tab, once you zoom in appropriately to your location, click the Use Map button, then click Data Sets to advance to the next section.\nSelect Landsat &gt; Landsat Collection 2 Level-1 &gt; Landsat 8-9 OLI/TRS C2 L1, then click Results. You might get a warning that you can ignore.\nClick on the footprint button for the appropriate coverage. Once you find the appropriate image, click the download icon.\nIn Download Options dialog box that appears, click the Product Options button and then click the top button for the “Bundle” - you’ll then need to unzip the files (no subfolders) into the lab9/data/landsat folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nIs your project folder organized properly? Are the necessary folders and files all there (hint: where will you st_write your files)?\nWhat are the comments like, both in r chunks and in text? Are they sufficient? Is the formatting of the markdown proper? Are the headers done properly? Are r chunks named appropriately (hint: is there a setup r chunk)?\nConsider the assignment Rmd incomplete and be sure fill it out as necessary. Hint: name your r chunks for debugging!\nAre the maps correct? Projected?\nAre the polished maps actually polished?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\n\nOn the first page, please include a short header. Please also include a link to your GitHub page and your GitHub website. Note that these are different.\nComplete assignment Rmd and answer all the questions in there. Knit it to html, then print to PDF and combine it with the cover page.\n\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted. You won’t be able to include the data, but what other files should you include and which folders should they go in?"
