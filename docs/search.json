Please check Blackboard for a link to this site, a link to the class Blackboard session, and the books. Please turn in all labs on Bb.\n\n\n\n\nThis course focuses on the methods for analyzing spatial data and provides an in-depth examination of technical aspects in spatial data handling, spatial pattern analysis, advanced raster processing, and dynamics GIS modeling. Students become familiar with advanced concepts, methods, and applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide general map development skills for the visualization, animation, scripting with spatial data.\nEnhance student’s abilities to initiate and complete a GIS project from proposal to end product which contains sound reasoning in the use of scientific methods.\nData management and R programming.\nExposure to open-source GIS software and new technologies.\n\nSatellite photos and machine-learning\nPoint clouds — specifically with open-source\n\nNew spatial analysis methods\nInteractive dashboards (can we use R Shiny for this in the class?).\nInternational data exposure (IPUMS).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine what constitutes a spatial analysis using GIS.\nUnderstand how GIS technology is implemented using open source software.\nComplete an independent research-based analysis utilizing main-stream GIS technology to address a scientific topic of societal concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll do the labs. On time. In order. This isn’t me being a stickler, it’s how the course scaffolds.\nNo makeup quizzes will be given. Contact me ahead of time if you’re going to miss a class.\nAttendance is expected.

If foreseen or unforeseen circumstances prevent you from completing an assignment on time, you may request an extension. Extensions must be requested in advance of the due date. If the situation warrants an extension, we will determine a new due date for the essay based on your individual circumstances.\n\n\n\n“Academic integrity has everything to do with one’s character.” -Former UMBC President Freeman Hrawbowski\nAcademic integrity is an important value at UMBC. By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.\n✅ Policy: https://oue.umbc.edu/ai/\n\n\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the UMBC requires students register with the Office of Student Disability Services and I will work with you and the SDS to ensure your success.\n\n\n\nDiscrimination and Sexual Harassment\nWith UMBC, I am dedicated to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of the campus community and recognizes its responsibility to maintain a campus environment which is free from Sexual Misconduct, and other Related Misconduct. This Policy embodies the University’s commitment to increasing awareness of such prohibited conduct and actively promoting prevention and educational programs for community members in an effort to eliminate occurrences, prevent re-occurrences, and address and remedy the discriminatory effects of the Sexual Misconduct. For additional resources, see UMBC’s policy posted online.\n✅ Policy: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/umbc-resource-page-for-sexual-misconduct-andother-related-misconduct/\n✅ File a complaint: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/file-a-complaint/\nIf you need to speak to someone, UMBC has the following resources available to support you:\n\nThe Counseling Center (confidential): 410-455-2472\nUniversity Health Services (confidential): 410-455-2542\nAfter-hours counseling and care available by calling campus police at: 410-455-5555\nThe Women’s Center (quasi-confidential): 410-455-2714\nTitle IX Coordinator (quasi-confidential): 410-455-1606\n\n✅ Additional on and off campus supports and resources can be found at: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexualmisconduct/gender-equitytitle-ix/"
