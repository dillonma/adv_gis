Know the difference between the backend (code) and the front end (formatted web page) to turn-in GitHub links. Assignments will be posted on Blackboard (links) and GitHub.\n\n\nComputing. I recommend using your own personal laptop in this course, however, you’re free to use one of the lab computers. I recommend using the same computer for each class.\nDiscord + Community. Technical learning alone is a recipe for disaster. Rely on your fellow classmates and ask questions in the class discord. This link is an invite for Discord for the first week of class. https://discord.gg/9wUhDdQV\nSchedule.. Mondays we will spend on lecturing. Wednesdays we’ll start with a quick in-class exercise before moving into lab time. Quizzes will be on Wednesdays.\n\n\n\nO’Sullivan, David. 2024.

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.\n✅ Policy: https://oue.umbc.edu/ai/\n\n\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the UMBC requires students register with the Office of Student Disability Services and I will work with you and the SDS to ensure your success.\n✅ Policy: http://sds.umbc.edu/accommodations/registering-with-sds\n\n\n\nWith UMBC, I am dedicated to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of the campus community and recognizes its responsibility to maintain a campus environment which is free from Sexual Misconduct, and other Related Misconduct. This Policy embodies the University’s commitment to increasing awareness of such prohibited conduct and actively promoting prevention and educational programs for community members in an effort to eliminate occurrences, prevent re-occurrences, and address and remedy the discriminatory effects of the Sexual Misconduct. For additional resources, see UMBC’s policy posted online.\n✅ Policy: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/umbc-resource-page-for-sexual-misconduct-andother-related-misconduct/\n✅ File a complaint: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexual-misconduct/file-a-complaint/\nIf you need to speak to someone, UMBC has the following resources available to support you:\n\nThe Counseling Center (confidential): 410-455-2472\nUniversity Health Services (confidential): 410-455-2542\nAfter-hours counseling and care available by calling campus police at: 410-455-5555\nThe Women’s Center (quasi-confidential): 410-455-2714\nTitle IX Coordinator (quasi-confidential): 410-455-1606\n\n✅ Additional on and off campus supports and resources can be found at: http://humanrelations.umbc.edu/sexualmisconduct/gender-equitytitle-ix/"

    "text": "Review the work we’ve done to date. See the useful links in all of the labs we’ve done to date. How might they help you? Are there any examples from this work that might be useful to you?\n\nWe learned how to use QGIS to create new print layouts.\nWe learned how to work with census data in interesting ways, visual design tips, and principles of reproducible research.\nWe learned more about census data, how to assemble multiple plots (and potentially maps) in ggplot, how to make leaflet web maps, how to move Alaska and Hawaii in US plots, and how to use the package tigris with tidycensus, and how to do change over time with the census. Most importantly check out the clustering examples in Chapter 7 of the Analyzing US Census book.\nWe mapped interesting data of our own and made maps (this could be a mini-final project, can you expand on this?)\nWe learned how to make hexagonal maps to combine points or to do area weighted calculations. And we did a Moran’s I to measure spatial clustering and dispersion.\nWe learned how to do correlations.\nAnd we learned how to do point pattern analysis and make heatmaps.\nOur next lab will look at data from rasters.\nWe’ll done one more spatial analysis lab.\n\n\n\n\nThe expectation is that the final project is at a minimum 20 hours of work. It is a semester long project.\nThe focus is on doing analysis on maps (not just mapping something) and thinking through how we can interpret what we map. For example, it’s not enough to map income in Baltimore. How is this related to other social or environmental variables? How did you compare/correlate/assess that relationship? In what ways did you investigate it with multiple plots, statistics, etc?\nI expect data come from multiple sources - so not JUST census data.\nI expect the analysis to be done in R following the guidelines of reproducible research. I recommend making polished maps in QGIS, although you don’t have to use QGIS, you can do it in any graphics editor. ArcGIS Pro and Desktop are not to be used.\n\n\n\nLook below and think through what a rough draft of the Introduction + Background section would look like as well as the Data + Methods section. Then write a 1-page proposal. This should contain links to the data and how you plan on manipulating the data. What you submit here does not have to be what you end up doing, but you have to be able to download and look at the data you plan on using.\n\n\n\nThere are multiple deliverables and they need to be submitted via Blackboard.\nYou should only submit TWO files on Blackboard.\nYour files as a zipped project folder. This should have an R project file. If you used QGIS, then it should include your QGIS project file. I recommend exporting finalized data from R and opening the shapefiles in QGIS. Use what we’ve learned about folder structure to organize your files.\nWhile the range of projects can vary, there are some particular\nA single PDF that includes:\n\nA cover page that includes your name, GitHub website link (github.io), and your GitHub website repository (github.io), and a link to your final project portfolio page that has a short description of your work (github.io).\nA 2-page research brief (like a report, 800-1200ish words) with these sections:\n\nIntroduction + Background. What is it that you’re studying? Why is it important? How is it connected to work you’ve done in other classes? Hint: use citations. What is it that you studied?\nData + Methods. Where did you get the data? How did you manipulate the data? How did you spatially analyze the data and why is that method useful (use citations). Explain each step. It may help to look back at your Rmd file and describe what you did.\nAnalysis + Results. What are the numerical results? What does your analysis tell us?\nConclusion. Interpret your results. What does this mean?\nReflection.\n\nWhat went well and didn’t go well for this project? What would you do differently next time?\nWhat went well and didn’t go well in the class? What would you have liked to have learned?\n\nNot as a separate section, but integrated into the text should be polished maps. I realize this will go over the 2 pages, but try to target 1,000 words total.\n\nA printed to PDF version of your final project portfolio page. It should not include all the of the debrief, just a summarized version of it. It does not need to be technical, but something short that someone who doesn’t know GIS should be able to understand. Here’s an example from last year, but I expect you to do better.\nGraduate Student Poster. A poster of your work (turned into a PDF and included in the single PDF). I’ll provide a template and some guidelines later.\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nSubmission (5). Did you submit the correct files?\nGitHub overall (10). Is your GitHub Portfolio in order? Do the links on the left work? Did you delete the extra content?\nGitHub Final Project Page (30). Did you include images on the Portfolio page and the Project page? Did you adequately describe your project for a lay person?\nReport (40). Did you do spatial analysis? Did you explain what you did? Did you cite examples from the books? Did you cite any examples outside of class?\nMaps (15). Do the maps follow design and color guidelines we’ve talked about? Is the North Arrow not enormous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted.

    "text": "Review the work we’ve done to date. See the useful links in all of the labs we’ve done to date. How might they help you? Are there any examples from this work that might be useful to you?\n\nWe learned how to use QGIS to create new print layouts.\nWe learned how to work with census data in interesting ways, visual design tips, and principles of reproducible research.\nWe learned more about census data, how to assemble multiple plots (and potentially maps) in ggplot, how to make leaflet web maps, how to move Alaska and Hawaii in US plots, and how to use the package tigris with tidycensus, and how to do change over time with the census. Most importantly check out the clustering examples in Chapter 7 of the Analyzing US Census book.\nWe mapped interesting data of our own and made maps (this could be a mini-final project, can you expand on this?)\nWe learned how to make hexagonal maps to combine points or to do area weighted calculations. And we did a Moran’s I to measure spatial clustering and dispersion.\nWe learned how to do correlations.\nAnd we learned how to do point pattern analysis and make heatmaps.\nOur next lab will look at data from rasters.\nWe’ll done one more spatial analysis lab.\n\n\n\n\nThe expectation is that the final project is at a minimum 20 hours of work. It is a semester long project.\nThe focus is on doing analysis on maps (not just mapping something) and thinking through how we can interpret what we map. For example, it’s not enough to map income in Baltimore. How is this related to other social or environmental variables? How did you compare/correlate/assess that relationship? In what ways did you investigate it with multiple plots, statistics, etc?\nI expect data come from multiple sources - so not JUST census data.\nI expect the analysis to be done in R following the guidelines of reproducible research. I recommend making polished maps in QGIS, although you don’t have to use QGIS, you can do it in any graphics editor. ArcGIS Pro and Desktop are not to be used.\n\n\n\nLook below and think through what a rough draft of the Introduction + Background section would look like as well as the Data + Methods section. Then write a 1-page proposal. This should contain links to the data and how you plan on manipulating the data. What you submit here does not have to be what you end up doing, but you have to be able to download and look at the data you plan on using.\n\n\n\nThere are multiple deliverables and they need to be submitted via Blackboard.\nYou should only submit TWO files on Blackboard.\nYour files as a zipped project folder. This should have an R project file. If you used QGIS, then it should include your QGIS project file. I recommend exporting finalized data from R and opening the shapefiles in QGIS. Use what we’ve learned about folder structure to organize your files.\nWhile the range of projects can vary, there are some particular\nA single PDF that includes:\n\nA cover page that includes your name, GitHub website link (github.io), and your GitHub website repository (github.io), and a link to your final project portfolio page that has a short description of your work (github.io).\nA 2-page research brief (like a report, 800-1200ish words) with these sections:\n\nIntroduction + Background. What is it that you’re studying? Why is it important? How is it connected to work you’ve done in other classes? Hint: use citations. What is it that you studied?\nData + Methods. Where did you get the data? How did you manipulate the data? How did you spatially analyze the data and why is that method useful (use citations). Explain each step. It may help to look back at your Rmd file and describe what you did.\nAnalysis + Results. What are the numerical results? What does your analysis tell us?\nConclusion. Interpret your results. What does this mean?\nReflection.\n\nWhat went well and didn’t go well for this project? What would you do differently next time?\nWhat went well and didn’t go well in the class? What would you have liked to have learned?\n\nNot as a separate section, but integrated into the text should be polished maps. I realize this will go over the 2 pages, but try to target 1,000 words total.\n\nA printed to PDF version of your final project portfolio page. It should not include all the of the debrief, just a summarized version of it. It does not need to be technical, but something short that someone who doesn’t know GIS should be able to understand. Here’s an example from last year, but I expect you to do better.\nGraduate Student Poster. A poster of your work (turned into a PDF and included in the single PDF). I’ll provide a template and some guidelines later.\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nSubmission (5). Did you submit the correct files?\nGitHub overall (10). Is your GitHub Portfolio in order? Do the links on the left work? Did you delete the extra content?\nGitHub Final Project Page (30). Did you include images on the Portfolio page and the Project page? Did you adequately describe your project for a lay person?\nReport (40). Did you do spatial analysis? Did you explain what you did? Did you cite examples from the books? Did you cite any examples outside of class?\nMaps (15). Do the maps follow design and color guidelines we’ve talked about? Is the North Arrow not enormous?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted.

Follow the tutorial from Andrew MacLachlan, but don’t start from scratch, start from the Project folder/file here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wpg4aqcqrdsesrh/lab9.zip?dl=0\nTo download data from Earth Explorer:\n\nOn the Search tab, once you zoom in appropriately to your location, click the Use Map button, then click Data Sets to advance to the next section.\nSelect Landsat &gt; Landsat Collection 2 Level-1 &gt; Landsat 8-9 OLI/TRS C2 L1, then click Results. You might get a warning that you can ignore.\nClick on the footprint button for the appropriate coverage. Once you find the appropriate image, click the download icon.\nIn Download Options dialog box that appears, click the Product Options button and then click the top button for the “Bundle” - you’ll then need to unzip the files (no subfolders) into the lab9/data/landsat folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis I’ll be looking for while I’m grading.\n\nIs your project folder organized properly? Are the necessary folders and files all there (hint: where will you st_write your files)?\nWhat are the comments like, both in r chunks and in text? Are they sufficient? Is the formatting of the markdown proper? Are the headers done properly? Are r chunks named appropriately (hint: is there a setup r chunk)?\nConsider the assignment Rmd incomplete and be sure fill it out as necessary. Hint: name your r chunks for debugging!\nAre the maps correct? Projected?\nAre the polished maps actually polished?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurn in a single PDF.\n\nOn the first page, please include a short header. Please also include a link to your GitHub page and your GitHub website. Note that these are different.\nComplete assignment Rmd and answer all the questions in there. Knit it to html, then print to PDF and combine it with the cover page.\n\nA zip file of your Raster Data project properly formatted. You won’t be able to include the data, but what other files should you include and which folders should they go in?"

A single shapefile is often split into many files (e.g. .cpg, .dbf, .prj, etc.), the most important of which is the sacred .SHP file. To get all of this info into an organized spatial object in R is easy, and in fact, as is often the case in R, there are multiple packages and functions that will do this for you. Today, we’ll learn how to use the sf package to load a shapefile:\n\n#the first argument to the st_read function is the data source name (or dsn).

    "text": "3. Projection\nPeople tend to hate projections and generally don’t understand them very well. It is, however, VERY important that you project your data correctly. If you fail to do this, it’s highly likely that your spatial analyses will be wrong. So let’s learn how this stuff works.\nMaps tend to be two-dimensional; the Earth is not. A coordinate system is a way to locate everything on Earth’s surface in x and y space. The way we portray (pseudo-)spherical Earth on a flat surface is by using a projection. Each projection is associated with a particular coordinate system. There are a bazillion coordinate systems, and each coordination system comes with strong assumptions and distortions (and fan-base):\n\nGeographic Coordinate System (GCS): good ol’ latitude and longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds); we think of data in GCS as unprojected;\nUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM): lots of zones to choose from, Utah sits in 12N;\nState Plane Coordinate System: some states have their own systems, i.e. North Carolina Coordinate System\nNational systems: If working in another country, check out country-specific projections.\n\nEach coordinate system is tied to a datum. This is essentially a reference point, the starting point from which coordinates are measured (i.e. lat and lon are based on the equator and prime meridian). In R we can access the projection information for a spatial object using the crs attribute of the object:\n\nst_crs(states_geom) #view the data projection\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD83 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD83\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1983\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"GRS 1980\",6378137,298.257222101,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4269]]\n\n\nCoordinate reference systems (CRS) are like measurement units for coordinates: they specify which location on Earth a particular coordinate pair refers to. sfc objects have two attributes to store a CRS:epsg and proj4string. proj4string is a generic, string-based description of a CRS, understood by the PROJ library. It defines projection types and (often) defines parameter values for particular projections, and hence can cover an infinite amount of different projections. This library (also used by GDAL) provides functions to convert or transform between different CRS. epsg is the integer ID for a particular, known CRS that can be resolved into a proj4string. Some proj4string values can resolved back into their corresponding epsg ID, but this does not always work.\nThe importance of having epsg values stored with data besides proj4string values is that the epsg refers to particular, well-known CRS, whose parameters may change (improve) over time; fixing only the proj4string may remove the possibility to benefit from such improvements, and limit some of the provenance of datasets, but may help reproducibility.\nOur data is currently in the WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System which plots locations on a sphere using longitude and latitude (but does not project these coordinates into two-dimensional space).\n\nepsg: 4269\nproj4string: “+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +no_defs”\n\nWe get that long string by searching for the projection on epsg.io and clicking the PROJ.4 link.\nIf we have any plans to use the spatial data to compute distance or area, then we need to project our data. This is fairly straightforward in R. Say we want to reproject this dataset into USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic:\n\nstates_conic &lt;- st_transform(states, CRS(\"+proj=aea +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=37.5 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs\"))\n\n# HINT: what is the epsg for albers equal area conic? how could statement be easier?\n\nDon’t forget that the map projection you use strongly impacts the way you visualize and analyze your data (see here or here)."

You can find a list of commonly used point symbols here.\n\n\nPolygons\nMost of the polygon data you will need has already been built by someone else, so we do not often build polygons from scratch. There are however instances when this might be a useful skill to master. For example defining study area boundaries.\nTo do this in R, we have to build each individual polygon and bundle them all together. Let’s start by building a set of simple polygons describing the outline of two study areas (in this example, the coordinates are arbitrary; in the real world, you’d have actual coordinates). The rbind() function pulls together each set of coordinates (i.e. c(1,1)) and binds them together in separate rows to create a mini-matrix of coordinates. Note that the order in which you list the coordinates is the order in which R will draw the polygons so be sure to list them in the correct order.\n\nsite1 &lt;- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(3,2), c(2,4), c(1,4), c(0,0))))\nsite2 &lt;- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(3,0), c(4,0), c(4,1), c(3,1), c(3,0))))\n\n#Now, let’s bind the individual Polygon objects into a spatial polygon object\nsites &lt;- st_sfc(site1, site2)\nplot(sites)\n\n\n\n\nSpatial polygons are cool and all, but polygons with attribute data are much cooler. How do we add data to our new spatial polygons? sf makes it easy to turn spatial data into spatial data.frames.\n\npol_sf &lt;- st_sf(data.frame(ID = c(1,2), Observations = c(100, 5)), sites) \nprint(pol_sf)\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 0 ymin: 0 xmax: 4 ymax: 4\nCRS:           NA\n  ID Observations                          sites\n1  1          100 POLYGON ((0 0, 1 0, 3 2, 2 ...\n2  2            5 POLYGON ((3 0, 4 0, 4 1, 3 ...\n\n\nNow we can plot our sites to display an attribute! For instance the number of observations at each site.\n\nplot(pol_sf[\"Observations\"])\n\n\n\n\nYou can apply the same basic principles to make each of the spatial geometry types in sf:\n\nPOINT: zero-dimensional geometry containing a single point\nLINESTRING: sequence of points connected by straight, non-self intersecting line pieces; one-dimensional geometry\nPOLYGON: geometry with a positive area (two-dimensional); sequence of points form a closed, non-self intersecting ring; the first ring denotes the exterior ring, zero or more subsequent rings denote holes in this exterior ring\nMULTIPOINT: set of points; a MULTIPOINT is simple if no two Points in the MULTIPOINT are equal\nMULTILINESTRING: set of linestrings\nMULTIPOLYGON: set of polygons"

Remember st_read() from back when you started this exercise? To write out a spatial data file (like a shape file) you just use st_write().\nLet’s write out the polygon dataframe we created above as a shapefile.\n\nst_write(pol_sf, \"../data/imaginary_sites.shp\") # this will write output to your working directory\n\nWriting layer `imaginary_sites' to data source \n  `../data/imaginary_sites.shp' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nWriting 2 features with 2 fields and geometry type Polygon.\n\n# st_write(pol_sf, dsn = \"..data/\", layer = \"imaginary_sites.shp\", driver = \"ESRI Shapefile\") #you can also specify a folder to write the shape file using the dsn argument\n\nIf we repeat this code, we would get an error message that the file already exists, but we can force a file overwrite by using:\n\nst_write(pol_sf, \"../data/imaginary_sites.shp\", delete_layer = TRUE)\n\nDeleting layer `imaginary_sites' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nWriting layer `imaginary_sites' to data source \n  `../data/imaginary_sites.shp' using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nWriting 2 features with 2 fields and geometry type Polygon.\n\n\nWe have written out a classic ESRI Shapefile but there are lots of other drivers you can use found here."
