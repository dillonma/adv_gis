### Course Focus and Guiding Questions

This course focuses on the methods for analyzing spatial data and provides an in-depth examination of technical aspects in spatial data handling, spatial pattern analysis, advanced raster processing, and dynamics GIS modeling. Students become familiar with advanced concepts, methods, and applications of Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

### Course Objectives and Goals

#### We will be pursuing a host of *goals*.

1.  Provide general map development skills for the visualization, animation, scripting with spatial data.

2.  Enhance student's abilities to initiate and complete a GIS project from proposal to end product which contains sound reasoning in the use of scientific methods.

3.  Data management and R programming.

4.  Exposure to open-source GIS software and new technologies.

    1.  Satellite photos and machine-learning

    2.  Point clouds --- specifically with open-source

5.  New spatial analysis methods.

6.  Interactive dashboards.

7.  International data exposure (IPUMS).

#### You'll be assessed on three *outcomes.*

1.  Define what constitutes a spatial analysis using GIS.

2.  Understand how GIS technology is implemented using open source software.

3.  Complete an independent research-based analysis utilizing main-stream GIS technology to address a scientific topic of societal concern.

#### As policy, in this course, I have *expectations* of you.

1.  You'll do the labs. On time. **In order**. This isn't me being a stickler, it's how the course scaffolds.

2.  No makeup quizzes will be given. Contact me ahead of time if you're going to miss a class.

3.  Attendance is expected. Missing more than a couple classes will significantly reduce your grade.

**Blackboard.** This is the course outline and schedule. Please check [**Blackboard**](https://my3.my.umbc.edu/go/blackboard) for a link to this site, a link to the class Blackboard session. Turn all assignments in on Blackboard. Know the difference between the backend (code) and the front end (formatted web page) to turn-in GitHub links. Assignments will be posted on Blackboard (links) and GitHub.
:::

**Computing.** I recommend using your own personal laptop in this course, however, you're free to use one of the lab computers. I recommend using the same computer for each class.

**Discord + Community.** <mark>Technical learning alone</mark> is a recipe for disaster. Rely on your fellow classmates and ask questions in the class discord. This link is an invite for Discord for the first week of class. <https://discord.gg/9wUhDdQV>

**Schedule.**. Mondays we will spend on lecturing. Wednesdays we'll start with a quick in-class exercise before moving into lab time. Quizzes will be on Wednesdays.

::: callout-warning
## Late Work

You do <mark>**yourself**</mark> a disservice when you turn in late work or skip assignments. It hampers your ability to build. Don't do it!
:::

Late work will be deducted 5% per twenty-four hour period that elapses after the due date. If foreseen or unforeseen circumstances prevent you from completing an assignment on time, you may request an extension. Extensions must be requested in advance of the due date. If the situation warrants an extension, we will determine a new due date for the essay based on your individual circumstances.

### Plagiarism

"Academic integrity has everything to do with one's character." -Former UMBC President Freeman Hrawbowski

Academic integrity is an important value at UMBC. By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal.

### Disabilities

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Moreover, the UMBC requires students register with the Office of Student Disability Services and I will work with you and the SDS to ensure your success.
